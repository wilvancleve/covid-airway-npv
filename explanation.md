### Summary (Written April 3 2020)

This calculator uses estimates for the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, as well as estimates for the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in the community to assess the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during intubation of an individual with a recently negative SARS-CoV-2 test. A low probability (definted by the operator or healthcare system, not by our research team *could* justify the use of droplet (rather than airborne) precautions during airway management.

### SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

The characteristics of tests being used to detect viral PCR are evolving. It is generally believed that viral PCR tests have very high *specificity*, 
but the *sensitivity* of testing require datasets that do not, as of the publication of this calculator, exist. The most important 
piece of reference information is a 'gold standard' against which to compare RT-PCR testing of a specific anatomic site.
                    
One clinical report, [published in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762997), reported that the 'clinical sensitivity' of nasal swabs could be as low as 63%, though the sample size was very low.

As a result, the default sensitivity in our calculator is 60%, to demonstrate a 'to use the 'worst case scenario' and the implications for NPV"),

### COVID-19 Prevalence Among Asymptomatic Individuals

To have high confidence in the SARS-CoV-2 test result, it is necessary to understand the negative predictive value: i.e., probability that the disease 
is not present when the test is negative. NPV is separate from the intrinsic test performance and requires knowledge of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in our community.

This enables us to answer how probable it is that our patient who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative is truly free of disease. You can estimate what the community prevalence is based on local hospitalization rates for SARS-CoV-2 and prior knowledge about how frequently hospitalization occurred in places (e.g. Wuhan) in  which SARS-CoV-2 was widespread and testing was as well.

Our rough estimate of current population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington state is 0.6% (UI: 0.41% - 0.82%) but this estimate is for all individuals, the majority of whom are symptomatic.

### Conclusion

Based on current estimates of prevalence (April 2 2020), the chance of asymptomatic patient with a recent negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 exposing a HCW
to SARS-CoV-2 during airway management appears to be low. Such a calculation could be used to inform a hospital's Infection Control policies defining appropriate HCW personal 
protective equipment during airway managment.
